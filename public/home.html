<h1> - More than cake - </h1>
<h2>Welcome! I'm Heather Oliver, the baker and cake decorator behind Pine Baking Co. I'm an Art Institute of Salt Lake City graduate with a degree in Baking & Pastry. I am all about baking from scratch. My cakes are densely delicious, my buttercream smooth and silky. Each cake is uniquely designed for each client. I love to know as much as I can about your vision and style for the event to draw inspiration. Together we can create the perfect cake for your special occasion. </h2>
